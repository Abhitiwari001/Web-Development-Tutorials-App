    <string name="html_definition"> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It was created vy Berners-Lee in late 1991, which is the most widely used language on web to develop web pages. \n\n Web browsers can read HTML files and compose them into visible or audible web pages. Browsers do not display the HTML tags and scripts, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML describes the structure of a webpage semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language. </string>
    <string name="html_getting_started"> HTML files are just simple text files, so to start writing in HTML, you need a simple text editor like Notepad(PC) or TextEdit(Mac) will be easy. HTML can be edited by using a professional HTML editor like Adobe Dreamweaver, MIcrosoft Expression Web, CoffeeCup HTML Editor. \n You can try HTML in your phone itself by clicking on below button </string>

    <string name="select_box_using_ng_repeat">You can also use the ng-repeat directive to make the same dropdown list, the ng-repeat directive
repeats a block of HTML code for each item in an array, it can be used to create options in a
dropdown list, but the ng-options directive was made especially for filling a dropdown list with
    options"</string>

    <string name="select_box_using_ng_repeat2">The advantage of using ng-option is, Dropdowns made with ng-options allows the selected value to
be an object, while dropdowns made from ng-repeat has to be a string.</string>
    <string name="datasource">In the below example, selected value will always be the value in a key-value pair, the value in a
key-value pair can also be an object. The options in the dropdown list does not have to be the key in
a key-value pair, it can also be the value, or a property of the value object.</string>
    <string name="angularmodel">The ngModel directive binds an input ,select, textarea (or custom form control) to a property on the
scope using NgModelController, which is created and exposed by this directive.
ngModel is responsible for:
Binding the view into the model, which other directives such as input, textarea or select require.
Providing validation behavior (i.e. required, number, email, url).
Keeping the state of the control (valid/invalid, dirty/pristine, touched/untouched, validation errors).
Setting related css classes on the element (ng-valid, ng-invalid, ng-dirty, ng-pristine, ng-touched,
ng-untouched, ng-empty, ng-not-empty) including animations.
Registering the control with its parent form.</string>
    <string name="angularmodel2">One of the core feature of AngularJS which makes it popular is two way data binding. In two way
data binding, any changes to the model are immediately reflected in the View and any changes in
the View updates the model.</string>
    <string name="angularevents">AngularJS has its own HTML events directives, the event directives allows us to run AngularJS
functions at certain user events. An AngularJS event will not overwrite an HTML event, both events
will be executed.</string>

is clicked again, like a dropdown menu,this will make the button behave like a toggle switch.</string>

True.</string>
    <string name="scope1">The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).The scope
is an object with the available properties and methods, is available for both the view and the
controller.</string>
    <string name="scope2">When adding properties to the $scope object in the controller, the view (HTML) gets access to these
properties. In the view, you do not use the prefix $scope, you just refer to a propertyname, like
{{bikename}}.</string>
    <string name="scope3">It is important to know which scope you are dealing with, at any time.In the two examples above
    there is only one scope, so knowing your scope is not an issue, but for larger applications there can
    be sections in the HTML DOM which can only access certain scopes.</string>
    <string name="anim3"> The ngAnimate module adds and removes classes. The ngAnimate module does not animate your
    HTML elements, but when ngAnimate notice certain events, like hide or show of an HTML
    element, the element gets some pre-defined classes which can be used to make animations.</string>
    <string name="anim4">The ng-show and ng-hide directives adds or removes a ng-hide class value. The other directives
adds a ng-enter class value when they enter the DOM, and a ng-leave attribute when they are
removed from the DOM.</string>
    <string name="anim5">The ng-repeat directive also adds a ng-move class value when the HTML element changes position.
    In addition, during the animation, the HTML element will have a set of class values, which will be
    removed when the animation has finished. Example: the ng-hide directive will add these class
        values.</string>
